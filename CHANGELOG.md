### 0.4.0    2019-04-29

- Started writing `CHANGELOG.md`
- Added `ext_messages` so now `echo` and its family are supported (considering
    we already had `ext_cmdline`, cmdline should be all supported)
- Added tooltip for cmdline so that in case of big messages user can see the
    whole message by hovering the mouse over it
